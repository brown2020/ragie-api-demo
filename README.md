## Overview

This project uses Next.js 14, Vercel AI SDK, and the Ragie API to build an interactive web application that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The application enables users to upload documents, retrieve content chunks from them, and generate AI responses based on those chunks in real-time.

## Features

- **File Management**: Upload documents to Firebase Storage and manage them in Firestore.
- **Retrieval of Chunks**: Fetch relevant content chunks using the Ragie API based on user queries.
- **Content Generation**: Generate responses using various AI models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, Fireworks) with retrieved information.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Stream AI-generated responses to the client in real-time using Vercel AI SDK.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to different parts of the app with Clerk middleware.
- **Planned Feature**: Enable users to add their own API keys via the client and choose to use their keys or purchase project credits.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an advanced AI technique that enhances the generation of content by combining information retrieval with natural language generation.

### How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, relevant chunks of information are fetched from a dataset using a retrieval API (like Ragie) to provide context.
2. **Generation**: An AI model generates a response using the retrieved information. The generated content is thus more accurate and contextually relevant to the user’s query.

### Why RAG is Important

- **Enhanced Relevance**: By grounding AI responses in actual, relevant data, RAG significantly improves the relevance and accuracy of generated content.
- **Scalability**: RAG can handle a broad range of queries by dynamically retrieving only the necessary information, which reduces the need for fine-tuning large models on specific datasets.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Streaming responses allow for real-time interaction, providing immediate feedback to the user.

RAG is particularly valuable in applications such as customer support, research, content creation, and anywhere precise and relevant information needs to be generated dynamically.

## About Ragie

**Ragie** is a powerful API platform that provides secure retrieval-augmented generation capabilities for developers. With Ragie, you can efficiently retrieve and generate relevant content based on user queries by integrating various documents and metadata.

### Key Concepts

1. **Documents**:

   - Files are imported into Ragie as documents. Their contents are processed to extract semantic information, enabling efficient retrieval.
   - Ragie supports various file types, including structured and unstructured data. Even images within documents are processed to extract their semantic data.
   - Documents can include optional metadata, which can be used later to filter retrieval results. The file associated with a document can be updated, replacing the previous version in future retrieval results.

2. **Metadata**:

   - An arbitrary object that is stored with a document and can be used to pre-filter retrieval results. This is useful for various use cases, such as implementing permissions, categorization, and search optimization.

3. **Retrieval**:

   - A natural language query can be made using Ragie’s retrieval API, optionally including a metadata filter. This returns a list of relevant content chunks that are suitable for providing context to a large language model (LLM). Ragie supports various options that allow users to trade-off between retrieval speed and quality.

4. **Connectors**:

   - Ragie offers out-of-the-box connectors to simplify document ingestion from commonly used services such as Google Drive, Notion, Confluence, Salesforce, Jira, and Onedrive. Changes made in the connected service are synchronized with Ragie automatically.

5. **SDKs**:
   - Ragie provides SDKs in popular programming languages such as TypeScript and Python, offering a smoother developer experience by abstracting direct HTTP calls.

### How Ragie Works

- **Data Loading**: Data is loaded into Ragie by posting files to the `/documents` endpoint. Metadata can be attached to documents to support flexible filtering at retrieval and generation time.
- **Retrieval**: Once documents are in Ragie, you can semantically search them using the `/retrievals` endpoint. The API allows options like `rerank` to improve retrieval quality.
- **Generation**: Using the chunks retrieved, Ragie can provide relevant context to language models, which can then generate accurate responses based on the data provided.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: A powerful React framework optimized for web application development.
- **Vercel AI SDK**: A toolkit to enhance AI capabilities in Next.js applications.
- **Ragie API**: An API to retrieve content chunks from datasets for context-aware generation.
- **Firebase**: For managing file uploads and storing metadata.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript for type-safe code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.
- **Clerk**: A platform for user authentication and access control.

## Usage

### File Management

1. **Upload Documents**:

   - Go to the \*\*File Management\*\* page and upload documents to Firebase Storage. The metadata for each document will be stored in Firestore.

2. **Manage Documents**:
   - View the list of uploaded documents, and upload them to Ragie for retrieval-augmented generation.

### Retrieving Chunks

1. **Enter Query**:
   - On the **Query Retrieval** page, enter a question or query.
2. **Retrieve Chunks**:
   - The application uses Ragie to retrieve relevant content chunks from the uploaded documents. The retrieved chunks are displayed on the page.

### Retrieving and Generating Content

1. **Ask a Question**:
   - On the **Generate Content** page, enter a question.
2. **Retrieve and Generate**:
   - The application first retrieves relevant chunks using Ragie and then generates a response based on these chunks using an AI model. The response is streamed to the client in real-time.

## Streaming Responses

### Server Action for Streaming

The `generateWithChunks` function in `generateActions.ts` demonstrates how to use the Vercel AI SDK to handle streamed responses:

```typescript
export async function generateWithChunks(
  chunks: string[],
  query: string,
  modelName: string
): Promise<ReturnType<typeof generateResponse>> {
  const chunkText = chunks.join("\n");
  const systemPrompt = `You are "Ragie AI"...`;
  return generateResponse(systemPrompt, query, modelName);
}
```

### Client-Side Handling of Streaming Responses

```typescript
const result = await generateWithChunks(
  data.scored_chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
  query,
  "gpt-4o"
);

// Correctly stream the response to handle progressive updates
for await (const content of readStreamableValue(result)) {
  if (content) {
    setGeneratedContent((prevContent) => prevContent + content.trim());
  }
}
```

## Upcoming Features

- **Client-Side API Key Management**: Allow users to input their own API keys in the client and choose whether to use their own keys or purchase project credits.
- **Dynamic API Key Selection**: Users can toggle between using their API keys or the project's keys.

## Deployment
